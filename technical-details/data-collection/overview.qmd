## Introduction and Motivation

Food waste is a global issue with profound economic, environmental, and social implications. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), roughly one-third of all food produced globally—about 1.3 billion tons—is wasted annually, leading to significant losses in natural resources, energy, and human labor (FAO, 2013). In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that food waste constitutes 24% of municipal solid waste, making it the single largest category in landfills (EPA, 2021).

This analysis examines a comprehensive dataset capturing the surplus and waste of various food categories, along with their nutritional compositions. The goal is to uncover insights into:

	1.	The patterns and drivers of food surplus and waste.

	2.	The relationship between nutrient density and food waste across categories.

	3.	How resources like water and energy are impacted by food wastage.

By quantifying these metrics and exploring trends, this analysis aims to inform policies and interventions to mitigate food waste while addressing nutritional and environmental challenges.
