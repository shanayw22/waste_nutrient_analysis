# Methods

This analysis employs a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), normalization, and statistical modeling techniques to draw insights from the data.

## 1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•	Data cleaning includes handling missing values, standardizing nutrient columns to consistent units (e.g., grams or milligrams per serving), and addressing outliers.

•	Visualization of key metrics like food surplus, waste, and nutrient content over time is used to identify patterns.

## 2.	Standardization of Nutrient Columns:

Nutritional data for protein, fat, carbs, fiber, vitamins, and minerals were often expressed in inconsistent units across the dataset (e.g., grams for macronutrients and milligrams for micronutrients). Standardizing these units enables meaningful comparisons across categories. For example:

•	Macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs) are standardized to grams per serving.

•	Micronutrients (iron, calcium, potassium) are converted to milligrams per serving.

## 3.	Statistical Summaries and Relationships:

•	Correlation analysis is used to identify links between food waste and nutrient density.

•	Regression models explore relationships between waste generation and external factors like supply and surplus.

## 4.	Clustering Nutritional Profiles:

•	Techniques like K-Means are applied to group food categories based on nutritional similarity, highlighting waste trends in nutrient-dense versus nutrient-poor foods.

These methods provide a robust framework for understanding food waste and its nutritional implications while offering actionable insights.
