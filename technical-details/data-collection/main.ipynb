The food waste data was sourced from the ReFED API, which provided insights into food surplus and waste across various food categories, along with their environmental and economic impact.\n",

    "## Data Source Information\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFood Waste Data: The food waste data comes from the ReFED Food Surplus Database, which is publicly available. It includes detailed food waste information, such as the category of food waste, food type, and surplus amounts. The data can be accessed from the following [link](https://insights-engine.refed.org/food-waste-monitor?break_by=destination&indicator=tons-surplus&view=detail&year=2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tNutrient Data: Nutrient data is fetched using the USDA Food Database API. The API provides detailed information on food products, including nutrient content (e.g., calories, protein, fat, etc.), serving size, food category, and other attributes. The API documentation can be found [here](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tOriginal Data: The IPNI Estimates of Nutrient Uptake and Removal dataset is extracted from a PDF document using the pdfplumber library. The extracted data is then processed and saved as CSV files for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAPI Use: The USDA Food Database API is used to gather detailed nutritional information for various food items. This includes attributes such as food name, serving size, brand, and various nutrients (protein, fat, carbs, vitamins, minerals, etc.). A Python script fetches data for each unique food name from the dataset food_waste. The API request is structured with parameters like food name and page size to collect relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevance to the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReFED Food Surplus Data is key to understanding food waste patterns across different food categories, helping identify the impact of food waste on the environment and the economy. The USDA Food Database is essential for providing the nutritional content of food items, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between food waste and nutrition. The IPNI Nutrient Data further supports the project by offering estimates of nutrient uptake and removal, which can be linked to food surplus and waste. These datasets together help analyze food waste, nutrients, and the overall environmental and health impact of wasted food.\n",
